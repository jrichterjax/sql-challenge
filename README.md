Data Modeling - an ERD image is included to indicate the tables to be created, as well as demonstrate the relationship between tables.



Data Engineering - a table schemata outlines the tables included in the tables.sql file; the tables.sql file includes the code used to create the necessary tables to import 6 employee data csv files - departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, and titles.




Data Analysis - the queries in the queries.sql file produce the following: 

- The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
- The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- The department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
